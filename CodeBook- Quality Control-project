# Codebook for Quality-control Project

## Project Description
Quality control project for analyzing various tests in the laboratory.

## Study Design and Data Processing
Retrospective analysis of quality control data.

### Collection of the Raw Data
Data collected from Cytoflex flow cytometry, BactAlert, and lab analysis. 

### Notes on the Original (Raw) Data
Each test type has a unique identifier (Sample ID). Administrative metadata include project/resource owner, principal investigator, project collaborators, funder, project period, etc.

## Creating the Tidy Datafile
Data is organized into a tidy format for analysis.

### Guide to Create the Tidy Data File
Utilize tools like Excel and MS Powerpoint for data structuring and visualization.
